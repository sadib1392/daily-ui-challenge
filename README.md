# Daily UI Challenge
Building a different UI every day using Figma and then building it out with HTML and CSS.

This challenge comes from the website https://www.dailyui.co/. 

It's self-explanatory really. Receive an email every day with a different type of UI you have to build out. Whether it's a form, an app, a landing page, etc., your job is to create it with the user experience in mind.

I took it a step further and used HTML and CSS to build the design after I completed it on Figma.

**Daily UI #1:** Create a sign up page, form, or app screen related to signing up for something. It could be fior a volunteer event, contest registration, a giveaway, or anything you can imagine.
